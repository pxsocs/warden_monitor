[MAIN]
; If enabled, mempool.space public API will be used to download address data
; there are privacy concerns with this option. It is recommended
; to use this option only for testing.
mspace_allow_public = TRUE
; Mempool.space is used to gather address information
mspace_public_address_0 = http://mempool.space/
; Mempool.space also has a public onion address
mspace_public_address_1 = http://mempoolhqx4isw62xs7abwphsq7ldayuidyx2v2oethdhhj6mlo2r6ad.onion/
; These can be changed to the location of your mempool.space instance
; onion addresses can be used. Include as many as you'd like
; the app will cycle through these in order until finding a
; good connection. If you have multiple nodes you can use them.
; Default for Raspiblitz
mspace_personal_address_0 = http://raspberrypi.local:4080/
; Default for Umbrel
mspace_personal_address_1 = http://umbrel.local:3006/

[TOR]
; Port usually is 9050 or 9150

host = 0.0.0.0
; For recent mac users, port 5000 is now being used by the macOS firewall.
port = 5001
; Setting this to true will enable WARden to be reached through an onion address

[API]
; API Keys can be changed. In fact we encourage you to get your own API Keys
; Although arguably there is reason to believe sharing keys with a broader audience
; may increase privacy. But this is debatable.
